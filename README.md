A Python script designed to scrape questions from the NiniSite website based on various psychological hashtags. This tool can gather relevant questions to analyze trends in mental health discussions.

## Background

This project aims to collect and analyze questions from NiniSite, which serves as a platform for discussions related to mental health, relationships, and personal development. The collected data can provide insights into common topics and concerns in these areas.

## Features

- **Scraping Functionality**: Efficiently collect questions related to mental health from NiniSite using specified psychological hashtags such as `#mentalhealth`, `#relationships`, and more.
- **Supports Pagination**: Automatically navigates through multiple pages to gather the desired number of links.
- **Data Output**: Saves the collected question links in both Excel and CSV formats for easy analysis and accessibility.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository or download the source code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sepidehparsa/NiniSite-Web-Scraper.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd NiniSite-Web-Scraper
   ```

3. **Install the required Python packages with pip**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
   ```

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory where the script is located.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python scraping_script.py
   ```

3. Upon successful execution, two output files will be generated in the same directory:
   - `question_links_grouped_with_urls.xlsx`: An Excel file containing the collected question links along with their associated hashtags.
   - `question_links_grouped_with_urls.csv`: A CSV file in a similar format for easy access and analysis with data tools.

## Example Output

After running the script, you will see the output files:
- **Excel File**: `question_links_grouped_with_urls.xlsx`, structured with columns for hashtags, their IDs, and the collected links.
- **CSV File**: `question_links_grouped_with_urls.csv`, providing the same information in a plain text format.

## Code Overview

### Main Components

- **Data Collection**: The script uses the `requests` library to fetch webpage content from NiniSite.
- **HTML Parsing**: The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse the HTML and extract relevant question links based on hashtags.
- **Storage**: Collected data is structured into a DataFrame using `pandas` and saved to Excel and CSV formats.

### Code Example

Hereâ€™s a snippet of the main scraping logic from the script to illustrate its functionality:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

def scrape_question_links(page_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, "html.parser")
    question_links = []
    
    for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
        href = link["href"]
        if re.match(r"^/clinic/question/\d+/.+", href):
            full_url = f"https://www.ninisite.com{href}"
            question_links.append(full_url)
    
    return question_links
```
